I've always been drawn to the world of technology and its ability to bring people together through immersive experiences. As a Data Engineer, I enjoy working with data and using it to build systems that solve real-world problems. My expertise in data processing, storage, and analysis has helped me to create efficient and scalable systems that can handle large volumes of data.

In my free time, I love to explore my creative side by working on game design projects using Unity. I find that the process of designing and building a game is both challenging and rewarding. From gameplay mechanics and level design to audio and visual effects, every aspect of game design requires attention to detail and creative problem-solving.

I'm excited to continue growing my skills and exploring new avenues for my passions. If you're interested in working together on a project or just want to chat about data engineering or game design in Unity, feel free to reach out!
